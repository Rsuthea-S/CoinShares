# CoinShares
for CoinShares exercise 

Please view master branch for code
- I accidently produced this in Python3.8, not 3.9 as specified. This is completely my fault. Pandas 1.1.4 was used
- all code produced in main (including comments for questions). Yes it's not the best practice but for this task it seemed reasonable.
- please check the data directory for weekly candles for both BTC and ETH.
